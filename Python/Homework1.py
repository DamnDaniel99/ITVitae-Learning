Write a basic greeter script. Use proper variable names.
1. When the script runs, the script should first print:
Hello! What's your name?
2. The user should now be able to enter their name, use the input() function.
3. Lastly, the script should now generate the following output (where <NAME> is replaced with the user input from
the previous step):
Hello <NAME>!

Greet = input("Hello! What is your name? ")

print(f"Hello {Greet}!")
